Print a line of spaces as wide as the screen
printf '%*s\n' "${COLUMNS:-$(tput cols)}" ''
# If youâ€™re not sure if your shell will have the COLUMNS variable set,
# you can use ${COLUMNS:-$(tput cols)} instead (but this is a very bash-
# specific syntax), or just $(tput cols) (which is always slower).
