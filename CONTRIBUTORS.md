Contributing
============

Any contributions are welcome! When contributing code, please consider the following rules:

  * code indented by four spaces, no tabs. If you're using emacs, `M-< M-> M-x untabify` is your friend.
  * use comments
  * remember to make all variables `local`
  * commit messages in the following format:

        short description in imperative
        [blank line]
        longer description
    for example:
    
        add this file [instead of "added" or "adding" or "adds"]
        
        the file does this and that
    as for the length of the first line: if possible, use <= 50 characters (if you're using `vim`, just keep it yellow)
  * use common sense (read: I can't be bothered to write a full guide)
