Contributing
============

Any contributions are welcome! When contributing code, please consider the following rules:

    * code indented by four spaces, no tabs. If you're using emacs, `M-< M-> M-x untabify` is your friend.
    * use comments
    * remember to make all variables `local`
    * use common sense (read: I can't be bothered to write a full guide)
